## Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

#### Learnings from this project
In this project, I applied the skills I learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. 

Problem statement: 
You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
